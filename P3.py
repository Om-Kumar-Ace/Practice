#Accept two square matrices A and B of dimensions n√ón as input and compute their product AB.The first line of the input will contain the integer n. This is followed by 2n lines. Out of these, each of the first n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix A. Each of the last n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix B.Your output should again be a sequence of n lines, where each line is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes a row of the matrix AB.
