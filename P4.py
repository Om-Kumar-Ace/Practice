#The range of a list of numbers is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.

#Write a function named get_range that accepts a list of real numbers as argument. It should return the range of the list.

#Note

#(1) Avoid using built-in function such as max and min.

#(2) You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.
