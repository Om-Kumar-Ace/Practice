# Write a recursive function named linear that accepts the following arguments:

# P: a non-empty list of positive integers
# Q: a non-empty list of positive integers
# k: a positive integer
# It should return True only if both the conditions given below are satisfied:

# P and Q are of same length.P[i]=kâ‹…Q[i], for every integer i in the range [0,len(P)âˆ’1], endpoints inclusive
